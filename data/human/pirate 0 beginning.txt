Two goons, one dressed in a sassy gray jacket labeled "Leviathan is My GOAT, Sorry Kestrel", the other fumbling with a few of the same kinds of knives stuck on to your sleeves, which are turning red by the second with the bleeding cut caused by the knife still embedded into the wall.

			`As the airlock of your ship closes, your heard his loud, boomerang voice slipping in, "If you I am you I better finish the job good, or else-" the line cuts off as the airlock hisses shut.
