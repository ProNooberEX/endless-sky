					goto question
			label question1
			`	"Well, well...what do we have here..." Two goons, one dressed in a sassy gray jacket labeled "Leviathan is My GOAT, Sorry Kestrel", the other fumbling with a few of the same kinds of knives stuck on to your sleeves, which are turning red by the second with the bleeding cut caused by the knife still embedded into the wall. "Tell me young fella, are you the new guy around here that everybody is talking about?" He takes one knife from his buddy's hand and presses it against your throat slightly. "Answer me or else my blade will speak for me."`

				`	The goon looks at you for a second, and then spits at your right eye. "Piece of coward", he grumbles and stands up after retrieving the knife trapping you to the wall. "My grandmother would have done better." He sighs, "these newbies are getting soft I tell ya...soft." Shaking his head he raised his hands to greet you, "Carl GaSan," he says, extending a hand with a glove on.`

			`	The goon looks at you for a second, then spits at your left eye. "Flamboyant as hell", he grumbles and stands up, retrieving the knife trapping you to the wall. "My grandmother would have done better." He sighs, "These newbies are getting egos I tell ya...egos". Shaking his head he raised his hands to greet you, "Carl GaSan," he says, extending a hand with a glove on.`
			choice
			`	(Gingerly shake his hand.)`
				goto converse0
			label question2
			`	"You don't...know anything?", The goon's smile nearly cracks his already scarred face, "Oh man...this is..." His chuckles rang across the spaceport, halting curious onlookers and earning eyes from everywhere. "Ok ok" He smiles.`
			choice

				goto doublespat

			`	The goon's smile vanishes as fast as it had come. Looking at you for a second, he spits into to of your eyes with two quick movements of the mouth. "Flamboyant as hell and a piece of coward," he grumbles and stands up, after retrieving the knife trapping you to the wall. "My grandmother would have done better." He sighs, "These newbies are getting egos I tell ya...egos and softness." Shaking his head he raised his hands to greet you, "Carl GaSan," he says, extending a hand with a glove on, "Your stupidity is on another level if you consider yourself innocent of knowledge when you choose to live a life of looting and plundering."`

			`	"I'll get to the tip of the blade real fast..." GaSan says, twirling one of his knives in his free hand while hauling you up from the floor. "My superiors have assigned me to scout in the Northern Pirate Regions, I don't know what's in their brains but a journey there is a hell of a ride." His face contorts into disdain for just a second before regaining a smug smile. "However, a life of a new brat around would never rival mine, so..." His gaze meets yours while his smile widens, revealing two rows of golden teeth like a tiger in the process of chomping his prey. "Better get going, <first>."`
			choice
			`	(Silently backpedal away from him and run to your ship, taking off.)`
				goto converse1
			label converse1
			`	As the airlock of your ship closes, you hear his loud, boomerang voice slipping in, "If you know who I am you had better finish the job good, or else-" the line cuts off as the airlock hisses shut. Feeling the leftover sensation of cold blade metal on your neck and GaSan's temper, you probably need to go to get things done as required.`
