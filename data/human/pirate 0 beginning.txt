				`	"Well, well...what do we have here..." Two goons, one dressed in a sassy gray jacket labeled "Leviathan is My GOAT, Sorry Kestrel", the other fumbling with a few of the same kinds of knives stuck on to your sleeves, which are turning red by the second with the bleeding cut caused by the knife still embedded into the wall. "Tell me young fella, are you the new guy around here that everybody is talking about?" He takes one knife from his buddy's hand and presses it against your throat slightly. "Answer me or else my blade will speak for me."`

				`	The goon looks at you for a second, and then spits at your right eye. "Piece of coward", he grumbles and stands up after retrieving the knife trapping you to the wall. "My grandmother would have done better." He sighs, "these newbies are getting soft I tell ya...soft." Shaking his head he raised his hands to greet you, "Carl GaSan," he says, extending a hand with a glove on.`

			`	"You don't...know anything?", The goon's smile nearly cracks his already scarred face, "Oh man...this is..." His chuckles rang across the spaceport, halting curious onlookers and earning eyes from everywhere. "Ok ok" He smiles.`
