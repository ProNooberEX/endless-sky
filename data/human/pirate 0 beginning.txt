				`` "Well, well...what do we have here..." Two goons, one dressed in a sassy grey jacket labeled "Leviathan is My GOAT, Sorry Kestrel", the other fumbling with a few of the same kinds of knives stuck on to your sleeves, turning red by the second with the bleeding cut caused by the knife still embedded into the wall. "Tell me young fella, are you the new guy around here that everybody is talking about?" He took one knife from his buddy's hand and pressed it against your throat slightly "Answer me or else my blade would speak for me."`

				`The goon looked at you for a second, then spat at your right eye. "Piece of coward", he grumbled and stood up, retreaving the knife trapping you to the wall, "My grandmother would have done better." He sighed, "these newbies are getting soft I tell ya...soft". Shaking his head he raised his hands to greet you, "Carl GaSan" he said, extending a hand coated in glove.`

			`"You don't...know anything?", The goon's smiled nearly cracked his already scared face, "Oh man...this is..." His chuckles rang across the spaceport, halting curious onlookers and earning eyes from everywhere. "Ok ok" He smiled.`
